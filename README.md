# 🐍 42 Python Piscine — Modules 00 to 04  
**New Common Core · Milestone 2**

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my work for the **42 Python Piscine (New Common Core)**, covering **Modules 00 to 04**.

The Python Piscine introduces Python through progressively more complex projects, with a strong emphasis on:
- core language fundamentals
- clean and readable code
- robust error handling
- object-oriented design
- practical use of Python’s standard library

Each module focuses on a specific set of technical concepts that build on one another, moving from basic scripting to structured, fault-tolerant programs.

All code in this repository strictly adheres to the `flake8` coding standard, as required by the 42 Python Piscine evaluations

## 🧩 Modules Breakdown

<details>
<summary><b>🏁 Python00 — Python Fundamentals</b></summary>

**Focus:** Core language basics and program flow

**Technical skills acquired:**
- Basic Python syntax and script execution
- Standard input/output using `input()` and `print()`
- Conditional logic with `if / elif / else`
- Looping constructs (`for`, `while`)
- Writing and calling functions
- Understanding recursion and base cases
- Problem decomposition and control flow reasoning

This module establishes a solid foundation in Python and general programming logic.

<summary><b>🚨 Python02 — Exceptions & Error Handling</b></summary>

**Focus:** Writing robust and fault-tolerant Python programs

**Technical skills acquired:**
- Handling runtime errors with `try / except`
- Using `finally` blocks correctly
- Raising exceptions with `raise`
- Creating custom exception classes
- Inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class
- Designing meaningful error messages
- Preventing program crashes through controlled failure handling

This module emphasizes defensive programming and reliable application behavior.

<details>
<summary><b>📊 Python03 — Data Structures & Iteration</b></summary>

**Focus:** Efficient data handling and iteration patterns

**Technical skills acquired:**
- Reading command-line arguments with `sys.argv`
- Working with core data structures:
  - tuples
  - lists
  - sets
  - dictionaries
- Using built-in methods for each data structure
- Iteration patterns and sequence processing
- Writing generators using `yield`
- Manual iteration with `next()`
- List, dictionary, and set comprehensions
- Writing concise and Pythonic data transformations

This module strengthens data manipulation skills and introduces lazy evaluation.

<summary><b>🗄️ Python04 — File I/O & Streams</b></summary>

**Focus:** File handling and stream-based input/output

**Technical skills acquired:**
- Opening, reading, and writing files with `open()`
- Properly closing file descriptors
- Using context managers (`with ... as ...`)
- Writing to standard output and error streams:
  - `sys.stdout`
  - `sys.stderr`
- Handling common file-related errors:
  - `FileNotFoundError`
  - `PermissionError`
- Combining file I/O with exception handling
- Writing safe and predictable file-based programs

This module focuses on interacting with the filesystem while maintaining reliability and error safety.
